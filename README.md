# SecureEye
SecureEye is an advanced AI-powered tool for secure source code review. It conducts a thorough assessment of provided code to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks, evaluating for common attack vectors such as SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow, and remote code execution. SecureEye analyzes the code for secure coding practices, including input validation, output sanitization, authentication and access controls, and error handling. Based on its findings, SecureEye provides detailed recommendations for improving the code's security posture and mitigating any risks found. The tool may suggest changes to code architecture, libraries, and frameworks. SecureEye's comprehensive report includes a detailed description of each vulnerability found, its severity, and a snippet of affected code. The report also includes a walkthrough of the mitigation steps taken and a snippet of the updated, mitigated code, helping to ensure the application's security and integrity while minimizing the risk of future security incidents.
